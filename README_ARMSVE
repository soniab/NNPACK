Build NNPACK for ARMSVE 

Download:
    git clone https://github.com/chalmers-hart/NNPACK.git
    
Building:
    macro for SVE is enabled in include/nnpack.h file. 
    to build the NNPACK for ARMSVE architecture follow the instructions
        1) mkdir build 
        2) cd build
        3) export CC=~/gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu-gcc  [set path of the compiler]
        4) export CXX=~/gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu-g++ [set path of the compiler]
        5) 'cmake ..' to configure NNPACK 
        6) 'make' to create a static library libnnpack.a in build folder only




We note that NNPACK with SVE support is provided only for single thread. Winograd implementation for ARM-SVE has been tested for 512-bit, 1024-bit and 2048-bit vector lengths using Darknet framework.
